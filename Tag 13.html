                            <br>1 Corinthians 16:14
                            <br>This bible verse I like a lot, because you can understand it in different ways, I understand it as we should 
                            <br>do everything while we are in LOVE. Ceci this days was magical, I never been to Enschede before and I never
                            <br>had so delicious fries with joppie sauce before. Thank you for an amazing day with You, Al and Fabian.😍
                            <br>I loved every picture we took, and was so happy that you wanted for me to come along! I felt so honored!❤️❤️❤️
                            <br>In this first weeks of knowing you my life changed to a feeling I like to call cloudness, I was so happy and
                            <br>everything was beautiful and fluffy, this never changed! I Love you so much Ceci, my love for you is so deep
                            <br>and so real!❤️♾️
                            <br>We had really great talks that day and we also held hands for the very first time!!😍❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰
                            <br>We finished it with an amazing Dinner at KFC realizing how delicous it was and that we like public display of affection 😍
                            <br>Te amo mi novia linda! With you I always had and have and I am pretty sure will have the best time. 💕
