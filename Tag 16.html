                            <br>This is our place, a place where we could be completely ourselves, where we could relax, where we
                            <br>could forget time and live im here and now. These are my thoughts thinking of the lake where we used to go.
                            <br>Amor I have been a lot of times to this lake, but my my favorites were always with you. 
                            <br>Looking back on the past three month it feels like surreal how much time has past!! ❤️❤️❤️
                            <br>How the seasons have shifted and how close our see you again is. I Love You so much and I will probably 
                            <br>talk a lot about you when the TSA Agent asks me for my reason of travel. Cant wait to see you!❤️♾️
