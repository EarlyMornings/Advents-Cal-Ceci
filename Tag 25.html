                            <br>Proverbs 16:3
                            <br>Amor, this days is very special, because of many reasons. First it was our first time going dancing.
                            <br>That night was one to remember, we danced until sunrise, were kind of the last people and
                            <br> we had so much fun together, laughed, hugged, kissed and just enjoyed eachothers company.❤️❤️
                            <br>The other reason why it is so special, is because I gave you a bracelet! Everytime I feel lonely or sad,
                            <br>I look at mine, and know YOU are here, loving me unconditionally. You are so wonderful.❤️❤️❤️
                            <br> Te amo babe, to the best and most loving girlfriend of the entire world. I could not imagine someone else
                            <br> I would rather have by my side. I am in LOVE with you, and it gets stronger everyday.💕
                            <br> Te amo, my best friend, my LOVE, my soulmate and my partner!❤️🥰😍♾️
